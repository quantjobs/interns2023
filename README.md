Quant Internship Postings for 2023

We provide top intern programs separately for trading/QR and SWE.

Rankings - 

1 = Arguably the best firm in the world in every sense.
2 = Has one element that disqualifies it from being a top firm (e.g. culture, reputation, pay...) but is better than any tech company.
3 = Solid firms. Much better than a FAANG career with the possible exception of top unicorns and companies like Netflix.
4 = FAANG or slightly above FAANG level firms. As good as or better than Google, Facebook.
5 = Sub-FAANG level firms. There might be perks that justify them over FAANG, but on average they are worse.

If a firm needs to be addded or changed, submit an edit and it will be reviewed.
